                    I am a 2025 graduate of the undergraduate Chemical Engineering program at the University of Waterloo. My previous roles have given me valuable insight into the research world, process and manufacturing engineering, quality assurance, and developing and implementing sustainable policies and regulations. Throughout my degree, I gained international experience completing an 8-month international co-op in Hamburg, Germany, and a 6-month international exchange semester at Swansea University in Wales.

                    My primary area of interest is creating a more sustainable future. I am specifically interested in bioplastics and sustainable product development, and the renewable energy sector. I know I want to contribute to meaningful, inclusive, and impactful work in the STEM fields that focus on the environment and bettering society.

                My hometown is Kingston, but I studied Chemical Engineering at the University of Waterloo, and through international opportunities, I developed a love for travel. I was fortunate enough to go to Germany for 8 months for a co-op and then Wales for 6 months for an exchange semester, where afterwards, I did some travelling in Europe through TrustedHouseSitters. Immediately after finishing exams in my final semester, I went to Argentina for a month to volunteer on farms as a WWOOFer. These experiences have taught me a lot about myself, and they have given me an even greater appreciation for other cultures and people.

                I've grown up playing competitive sports my entire life and staying physically active has always been important to me. I have found new enjoyment through climbing and long distance running, while of course still enjoying the sports I grew up with, speed skating and soccer. I have tried surfing and wind surfing a few times and I would love to do more. Hiking and camping have also become favourite outdoor activities. Really, anything I can do outdoors, I enjoy. In quieter moments, I enjoy knitting, reading, listening to podcasts, baking, doing jigsaw puzzles, and language learning. Lately, I've been focusing on Spanish and German.

            <h3>Capstone Design Project: Mechanical and Materials Co-lead @ UW</h3>

                Gabura Union, in Bangladesh, faces water salinity issues that have only been increasing due to rising sea levels, with groundwater conductivity levels between 2060 and 3190 ¬µS/cm, far above the WHO water quality limit of 750 ¬µS/cm. Current desalination methods are costly and inaccessible to rural areas. Our team of 4 investigated a sustainable and small-scale solar still desalination system with the objective to be accessible to residents. The final design was composed of a water basin with a glass cover, enhanced with stilts and mirrors to direct sunlight onto its metallic base, improving heat transfer efficiency and desalinated water throughput.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was the mechanical and materials co-lead in the development of our modular design, as well as the administrative and organizational lead. Technical tasks included experimental testing, construction of the prototype, and the 3D modelling and assembly guide of the prototype using Autodesk Fusion 360. Administrative tasks included room booking and scheduling, meeting documentation, and overall file management.

                My team and I competed in the Map the System campus finals at UW in 2025 where we placed in the top 5 of over 50 applicants.

                    After completing my exchange in Wales, I decided to take the summer off to travel, and as a student, budget travel was the goal. I discovered TrustedHousesitters, a website that connects house and pet sitters with homeowners around the world, offering accommodation in exchange for pet care. As someone who has pets back home, it felt like a perfect fit. The homeowners showed me around before they left, and I had the chance to experience the local culture and explore the area like a local.

                    I knew that after finishing my final semester, I wanted to take a so-called "grad trip," but I wasn‚Äôt sure where to go or what to do. Many of my classmates had made plans with friends, but that wasn‚Äôt the case for me. Since I had started learning Spanish a year earlier and was eager to improve quickly, I decided to choose a Latin American country to immerse myself in the language. Some of my friends had taken part in a farming and gardening exchange through WWOOF in Portugal, which inspired me to look into it as another great budget-friendly travel option. After doing some research, I realized it would be a perfect fit.

                    I was fortunate to spend an entire month in Argentina working on two different farms, learning many new skills, immersing myself in Argentinian culture, improving my Spanish, and meeting amazing people.

                            In La Cumbre, I was helping build a greenhouse using stainless steel rods and polycarbonate. The farm was fully run on solar power, and we used a solar cooker to cook many of our meals. I learned about building a greenhouse in terms of materials, positioning, and the space inside, as well as about using a solar cooker.
