                    I am a 2025 graduate of the undergraduate Chemical Engineering program at the University of Waterloo. My previous roles have given me valuable insight into the research world, process and manufacturing engineering, quality assurance, and developing and implementing sustainable policies and regulations. Throughout my degree, I gained international experience completing an 8-month international co-op in Hamburg, Germany and a 6-month international exchange semester at Swansea University in Wales.

                    My two primary areas of interest are creating a more sustainable future and helping people. I am specifically interested in bioplastics and sustainable product development, and the renewable energy sector. While I’m still discovering exactly what will fit me best, I know I want to contribute to meaningful, impactful work in the STEM fields that focus on the environment, creating a more sustainable future, and bettering society.

                    Outside of all this, I love staying active and being outdoors through running, speed skating, soccer, climbing, hiking, water sports, you name it, I want to try it all. I love to travel, meet new people, and learn new languages as a way to connect with different cultures and perspectives.

                My hometown is Kingston, but I studied Chemical Engineering at the University of Waterloo and through international opportunities, I developed a love for travel. I was fortunate enough to go to Germany for 8 months for a co-op and then Wales for 6 months for an exchange semester where afterwards, I did some travelling in Europe through TrustedHouseSitters. Immediately after finishing exams in my final semester, I went to Argentina for a month to volunteer on farms as a WWOOFer. These experiences have taught me a lot about myself, and I gave me an even greater appreciation for other cultures and people.

                I've grown up playing competitive sports my entire life and staying physically active has always been important to me. I have found new enjoyment through climbing and long distance running, while course still ejoying the sports I grew up with, speed skating and soccer. I have tried surfing and wind surfing a few times and I would love to do more. Hiking and camping have also become favourite outdoor activities. Really anything I can do outdoors, I enjoy. In quieter moments, I enjoy knitting, reading, listening to podcasts, baking, jigsaw puzzles, and language learning. Lately, I've been focussing on Spanish and German.

                Gabura Union, in Bangladesh, faces water salinity issues that have only been increasing due to rising sea levels, with groundwater conductivity levels of 2060-3190 µS/cm, far above the WHO water quality limit of 750 µS/cm. Current desalination methods are costly and inaccessible to rural areas. Our team of 4 investigated a sustainable and small-scale solar still desalination system with the objective to be accessible to residents. The final design was composed of a water basin with a glass cover, enhanced with stilts and mirrors to direct sunlight onto its metallic base, improving heat transfer efficiency and desalinated water throughput.

            <!-- <p>
                I was the mechanical and materials co-lead in the development of our modular design, as well as the administrative and organizational lead. Technical tasks included experimental testing, construction of the prototype, and the 3D modelling and assembly guide of the prototype using Autodesk Fusion 360. Administrative tasks included room booking and scheduling, meeting documentation, and overall file management.

                    After completing my exchange in Wales, I decided to take the summer off to travel—and as a student, budget travel was the goal. I discovered TrustedHousesitters, a website that connects house and pet sitters with homeowners around the world, offering accommodation in exchange for pet care. As someone who has pets back home, it felt like a perfect fit. The homeowners showed me around before they left, and I had the chance to experience the local culture and explore the area like a local.

                    I knew that after finishing my final semester, I wanted to take a so-called "grad trip," but I wasn’t sure where to go or what to do. Many of my classmates had made plans with friends, but that wasn’t the case for me. Since I had started learning Spanish a year earlier and was eager to improve quickly, I decided to choose a Latin American country to immerse myself in the language. Some of my friends had taken part in a farming and gardening exchange through WWOOF in Portugal, which inspired me to look into it as another great budget-friendly travel option. After doing some research, I realized it would be a perfect fit.
